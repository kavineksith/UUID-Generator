# UUID Generator

A robust, production-ready UUID generator written in Python. This utility supports UUID v1 (time-based), UUID v4 (random), and timestamp-based UUIDs with optional prefix and categorization. It persists all generated UUIDs in an SQLite database and includes duplicate detection, metadata storage, logging, and stats reporting.

## üìå Features

* Supports UUID v1, v4, and custom timestamp-based UUIDs.
* Optional prefix and category for enhanced classification.
* Persists UUIDs in a SQLite database.
* Advanced logging with file rotation.
* Built-in statistics for generated UUIDs by type and category.
* Duplicate detection and custom exception handling.


## üöÄ Usage

Run the generator using the command line:

```bash
python uuid_generator.py --type <v1|v4|timestamp> [--category CATEGORY] [--prefix PREFIX] [--stats]
```

### Examples

Generate a v1 UUID with a category:

```bash
python uuid_generator.py --type v1 --category "session"
```

Generate a timestamp-based UUID with a prefix:

```bash
python uuid_generator.py --type timestamp --prefix ABC --category "order"
```

View usage statistics:

```bash
python uuid_generator.py --stats
```

## üìà Output

Example UUID output:

```
Generated UUID: 550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000
```

Statistics example:

```json
{
  "by_type": {
    "v1": 10,
    "v4": 8,
    "timestamp": 5
  },
  "by_category": {
    "session": 10,
    "order": 5
  },
  "total": 23
}
```
