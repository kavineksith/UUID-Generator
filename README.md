# UUID-Generator
A robust, production-ready UUID generator written in Python. This utility supports UUID v1 (time-based), UUID v4 (random), and timestamp-based UUIDs with optional prefix and categorization. It persists all generated UUIDs in an SQLite database and includes duplicate detection, metadata storage, logging, and stats reporting.
